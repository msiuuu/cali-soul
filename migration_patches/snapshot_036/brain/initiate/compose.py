"""Three-prompt composition pipeline.

Subject -> Tone -> Decision. Each prompt has exactly one job; the three
together prevent LLM-trained instincts from collapsing all decisions
into emotional state.

Layer 1 (subject): what is the thing? No emotion in context.
Layer 2 (tone):    how do I say it in my voice, right now? Subject is immutable.
Layer 3 (decision): send_notify | send_quiet | hold | drop? Sees only the
                    rendered message + send history.
