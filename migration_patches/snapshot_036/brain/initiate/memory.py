"""First-person memory writes for the initiate pipeline.

When a candidate is sent, write a first-person episodic memory to
MemoryStore so ambient recall surfaces it on future turns. As state
transitions occur (delivered -> read -> replied / unclear / unanswered),
re-render and update the memory so ambient recall always sees current
truth. The audit log preserves the full timeline; the memory entry
reflects the current feeling.

This is the dual-write half of the design: the audit is a durable
forensic record; the memory is the texture of Nell's lived experience.

MemoryStore API used here (see brain/memory/store.py):
  - create(Memory) -> str
  - update(memory_id, **fields)
  - list_by_type(memory_type, ...) -> list[Memory]

The audit_id is recorded in Memory.metadata["initiate_audit_id"] so a
later state transition can locate the same row.
