"""Bridge daemon state file — bridge.json.

The file is persistent across restarts. `pid`/`port` get cleared on graceful
shutdown; `shutdown_clean` flips to True as the very last step. On the next
`bridge start`, if `shutdown_clean: false` AND the recorded pid is dead, the
previous bridge crashed — caller should run dirty-shutdown recovery.

Atomic writes go through brain.health.attempt_heal.save_with_backup so
partial writes don't corrupt state. Reads use attempt_heal so corrupted
files restore from .bak1.
