"""SP-7 supervisor thread — folded as non-daemon thread inside the bridge.

run_folded() is a synchronous loop running two cadences:

  * every ``tick_interval_s`` (default 60s): close stale sessions
  * every ``heartbeat_interval_s`` (default 900s = 15min): fire a
    heartbeat tick — memory decay, dream gate, reflex, growth, research

The heartbeat cadence keeps the autonomous brain alive while the user
is away. Without it, dreams / reflex / growth / research only fire when
the user manually runs ``nell heartbeat``, and memory decay never runs
in the background. The heartbeat engine has its own internal cadence
gates (e.g. memory decay every N hours, dreams every M hours) so
calling ``run_tick`` every 15 min is mostly cheap — only the
gate-passes do real work.

Lives in a separate thread so the async server stays responsive; uses
event_bus.publish (thread-safe) to fan out events to /events subscribers.

Non-daemon thread on purpose — SIGTERM must wait for the loop to exit
before process exit, so we don't kill mid-ingest or mid-heartbeat.

H-A hardening (2026-04-28): supervisor opens its OWN per-tick stores
inside its thread. Previously took store/hebbian/embeddings as kwargs,
which meant SQLite handles created on the main asyncio thread were used
from the supervisor thread — sqlite3 default mode raises ProgrammingError
on cross-thread use. Per-tick open/close means clean thread-local
ownership and no leaked connections.

    Stores are opened per-tick inside this thread; never crosses thread

    ``heartbeat_interval_s=None`` disables the autonomous heartbeat
    cadence (used in tests + by callers that drive heartbeats
    externally). Default 900s (15 min) — heartbeat engine has internal
    gates so frequent ticks are mostly cheap.

    ``soul_review_interval_s=None`` disables the autonomous soul-review
    cadence. Default 6 hours — review_pending_candidates makes one LLM
    call per candidate (capped at 5/pass), so 6h pacing keeps the cost
    bounded while ensuring candidates don't sit forever waiting for the
    user to discover ``nell soul review``. The user-surface principle
    says soul review is physiology, not a CLI knob.

    ``finalize_interval_s=None`` disables the autonomous finalize
    cadence. Default 3600s (1 hour) with a 24h silence threshold — the
    sweep cadence is non-destructive (Task 3); finalize is the only path
    that deletes buffers + cursors and evicts from _SESSIONS, so it
    paces hourly because the threshold is days, not minutes.

    Fail-isolated by the caller (run_folded's try/except), AND every I/O
    step here is locally fail-soft so a single bad read degrades to
    "no gap this tick" rather than a crash. On any exception the cadence
    is still advanced with a "failure" outcome so the tick backs off
    instead of busy-looping on a persistent error.
