"""Process-global CLI throttle. Interactive chat has absolute priority and
never waits; background CLI consumers (dreams, reflex, research, soul review,
initiate, voice reflection, the reflection passes, backfills) yield while a
chat turn is in-flight / recently active, and respect a small concurrency cap.

Interactive code is never throttled — it simply does not call acquire_background.

Fails open: on any internal error, background is allowed and the error is logged
at WARNING every time (background calls are cadence-driven and infrequent, so
repeated warnings signal a genuine lock malfunction rather than spam). Closes
deferred item 26."""
