"""Aggregator for the NellFace app's panel data.

The app's left panels (Inner Weather, Body, Recent Interior, Soul,
Connection) all consume real-time persona state. The data already
exists across many subsystems — emotions in the memory store,
body in compute_body_state, interior in daemon_state.json, soul in
SoulStore, mode in BridgeState. This module composes them behind a
single dict so the bridge can serve them at one endpoint.

Design intent: the helper is FAIL-SOFT. Any subsystem that errors
contributes its empty/null value rather than raising — the panels
should degrade gracefully on a fresh persona dir or partial data.
The endpoint must return 200 even if half the brain hasn't booted
yet; the UI just shows missing pieces as empty.

Mode derivation is v1 minimal: "live" when the bridge is up and
the provider is reachable, "offline" otherwise. Provider-failover
("provider_down") becomes meaningful when the FailoverProvider lands;
until then, mode is binary.
