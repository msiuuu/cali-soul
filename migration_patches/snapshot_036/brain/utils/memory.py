    Cascades through the real data sources:

    1. Active session buffers — `<persona_dir>/active_conversations/*.jsonl`
       — find the newest user-speaker turn timestamp. This catches mid-
       session and just-closed conversations before ingest runs.
    2. Closed-session extractions — memories whose
       `metadata_json.source_summary` starts with `"conversation:"`.
       These came from a chat buffer that had user turns by definition;
       the memory's `created_at` is within minutes of the last user
       turn (when the ingest pipeline ran on session close).
    3. Fallback — 999.0.

    persona_dir is optional for backward-compat with legacy callers, but
    when omitted the function can only see closed-session signal — fresh
    chats won't update the count until the session closes.

    Used by reflex + research engines to gate on persona-silence duration,
    by get_body_state/boot brain-tools, and by the /persona/state
    aggregator. NOTE: the original implementation queried
    memory_type="conversation" — but no production code path writes that
    type (extracted memories are tagged observation/feeling/decision/
    question/fact/note). The query always returned [] → 999.0 fallback,
    silently breaking long-silence reflex arcs and body-state day-counts.
    Same root cause as the M-1 audit-2 fix to body/words.py.
