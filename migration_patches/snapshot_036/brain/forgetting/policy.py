"""policy.py — state machine + exemption gates per spec §4.

Pure functions. The orchestrator (ForgettingPass.run_pass) drives these.

Spec § for tunability:
    FADE_THRESHOLD   — salience < this drives active → fading
    LOST_THRESHOLD   — salience < this for LOST_PASS_COUNT consecutive
                       passes drives fading → lost
    LOST_PASS_COUNT  — two-pass safety guard against single-pass dips
    RECENT_LIVED_HOURS — memories younger than this in lived-age are exempt
