"""reconcile_self_read — the self-authored reconcile tool (self-model §3, §6).

When the companion notices her *declared* and *derived* emotional reads have
diverged (the ambient gap block), this is how she acts on it — by her own
choice, never anyone else's insistence.

Actions:
  accept / revise  — write a self-authored emotion delta for one channel,
                     bounded [-1, 1] + clamped, routed through the registered
                     vocabulary filter (off-vocab channels are dropped). The gap
                     is marked ``acknowledged`` and the channel gets a cooldown
                     (R-B2 anti-oscillation).
  dismiss          — let the gap pass; mark it ``dismissed`` + channel cooldown.
  name             — name an *unnamed pressure*. This NEVER mints a vocabulary
                     entry directly. It runs the existing guarded crystalliser
                     path (``crystallize_vocabulary`` → growth scheduler), which
                     only grows ``emotion_vocabulary.json`` from real memory
                     evidence with a proper half-life + description and dedups
                     against existing channels (R-A — the v0.0.32 stub-flood
                     stays closed).

The emotion write mirrors ``brain/chat/extractor.py::_apply_emotion_delta`` — a
tiny emotion-carrying Memory committed through MemoryStore, importance from
magnitude. There is no separate persisted emotion file; felt state is derived
from memory aggregation, so this is the correct (non-bypassing) way to influence
it.
