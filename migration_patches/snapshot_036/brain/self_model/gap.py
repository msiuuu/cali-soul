"""Gap — derived-minus-declared emotional divergence.

`compute_gap(declared, derived) -> Gap`

Pure compute, no I/O, no LLM.

The gap is the vector difference between the derived (trend/body) and the
declared (max-pool peak) emotional reads, restricted to REGISTERED channels.
Unregistered channel names — whether from stale vocabulary or synthetic tests —
are silently dropped (vocab-flood guard, R-A adjacent).

per_channel[c] = derived.channels.get(c, 0) − declared.emotions.get(c, 0)

for every channel c that:
  1. appears in EITHER derived.channels or declared.emotions, AND
  2. is registered in the emotion vocabulary (vocabulary.get(c) is not None).

Exact-zero deltas (declared == derived for that channel) are dropped from
per_channel to keep the dict sparse. This is a deliberate design choice:
a zero delta carries no information and would inflate magnitude calculations.

magnitude = sum(abs(v) for v in per_channel.values())

Orthogonality assertion (R-C1):
  - Divergent declared/derived   → magnitude > 0  (per_channel is non-empty)
  - Identical declared/derived   → magnitude == 0.0

unnamed_pressure is carried through from the derived read unchanged.

Gap dataclass fields per spec §4:
  per_channel        — {channel: delta}  registered-only, zero-deltas dropped
  magnitude          — sum of absolute deltas
  unnamed_pressure   — passed through from DerivedRead
  note               — optional Haiku-articulated note (None until Task 4)
  status             — "open" | "acknowledged" | "dismissed" | "resolved"
  first_seen_ts      — ISO-8601 UTC string, set by the caller / cadence layer
  last_seen_ts       — ISO-8601 UTC string, set by the caller / cadence layer
  sustained_ticks    — integer count, incremented by the cadence layer
  channel_cooldowns  — {channel: ISO-8601 UTC string} — set by reconcile layer
