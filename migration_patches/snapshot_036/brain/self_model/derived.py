"""Derived emotional read — recency-weighted mean + body physiology.

Orthogonal to the declared read (aggregate_state / max-pool):
  - declared = peak signal across memories (max-pool)
  - derived  = trend signal (recency-weighted mean) + body nudge

This module is pure compute. No I/O, no LLM, no side effects.
Fail-open: any error in compute_derived returns an empty DerivedRead.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Body → channel mapping (module constants, conservative)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The body adjustment is a *small nudge*, not a dominant term.
The recency-weighted mean is the primary signal.

Low-arousal nudge (low energy OR high exhaustion):
  Applied when body_energy <= 3 OR body_exhaustion >= 7.
  Channels nudged UP (by _BODY_NUDGE_AMOUNT):
    "grief", "loneliness", "rest_need", "comfort_seeking"

High-arousal nudge (high energy AND low exhaustion):
  Applied when body_energy >= 8 AND body_exhaustion <= 3.
  Channels nudged UP (by _BODY_NUDGE_AMOUNT):
    "joy", "desire", "curiosity", "arousal"

The nudge is added only for channels already present in the recency
mean (i.e. channels with non-zero recency weight). This prevents the
body from "inventing" channels that have no memory support.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
unnamed_pressure (Task 1b)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When the body is in an extreme low-arousal state (exhaustion >= 8 OR
energy <= 1), the body nudge maps onto low-arousal channels. If NONE
of those target channels appear in the recency mean, the body signal
has "nowhere to go" — this residual is reported as unnamed_pressure.

Floor condition (module const _UNNAMED_THRESHOLD = 0.0):
  unnamed_pressure > 0 ONLY when:
    - (exhaustion >= _UNNAMED_EXHAUSTION_FLOOR OR
       energy <= _UNNAMED_ENERGY_CEIL)                  ← extreme body
    AND
    - no low-arousal channel has any recency-mean support ← no home
  Otherwise named_pressure == 0.0 (R-E5: ordinary states are exactly 0).
