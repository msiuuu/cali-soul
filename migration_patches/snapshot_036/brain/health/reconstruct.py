"""Identity reconstruction — rebuild vocabulary from memory references.

When all backups of emotion_vocabulary.json are corrupt and reset would
otherwise fire, the brain re-learns its own vocabulary from how it has
been operating: scan memories.db for distinct emotion names, register
framework baseline + persona-extensions for any unknown names found.
