"""Append-only JSONL log reader with per-line corruption skip.

Generalises the pattern shipped in the Phase 2a hardening PR for the
growth log. Used by every ``*.log.jsonl`` reader in the brain —
heartbeats, dreams, reflex, research, growth.

Reads line-by-line off disk rather than loading the full file into a
single string + splitting. On a 500 MB log, the streaming path peaks
at roughly one line of memory; the previous
``path.read_text().splitlines()`` shape peaked at ~2× file size (the
raw text plus the list of split lines).

    """Yield parsed dict lines from ``path``, skipping malformed lines.

    Streaming variant — reads one line at a time off disk so memory
    stays bounded regardless of file size. Use this for tail readers,
    large-log scans, and anywhere the caller doesn't actually need
    the full list materialised. The list-returning
    :func:`read_jsonl_skipping_corrupt` is implemented in terms of
    this generator.

    Per-line resilience: a single corrupt line never invalidates the
    lines around it. Each skipped line emits a warning that includes
    the line number, the file path, the parse exception, and a 200-
    char preview of the bad content — enough for a human to find and
    quarantine the line.

    Non-dict JSON (lists, scalars, null) is skipped because the JSONL
    contract every caller assumes is "one dict per line." Audit
    2026-05-07 P3-4 added a warning for that case so a hand-edit or
    schema-drifted line can't disappear from readers without leaving
    a trail.
