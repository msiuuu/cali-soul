"""Rotation primitives for JSONL audit logs.

Two strategies, each a pure function over a single log path:

* :func:`rotate_rolling_size` — size-capped rolling archive. The active
  log is renamed once it crosses ``max_bytes``, gzipped to ``.1.gz``,
  and older archives shift up (``.1.gz`` → ``.2.gz`` → ...). The oldest
  beyond ``archive_keep`` is deleted. Used for noisy logs where deep
  history doesn't carry per-line value (heartbeats, dreams,
  emotion_growth).

* :func:`rotate_age_archive_yearly` — splits a log's entries by the year
  in their ``at`` field. Cold years are archived to ``<stem>.<year>.jsonl.gz``;
  the current year stays in active. Archives are kept forever — the
  soul-audit case where every decision must remain reachable.

Both functions:

* Are no-ops when the log file doesn't exist (idempotent fresh-install).
* Open files via streaming iteration so memory stays bounded regardless
  of log size.
* Leave the active log intact on partial failure — the alternative is
  silently losing audit data.

    Algorithm:

    1. Stat the file. Below cap → no-op.
    2. Shift existing archives up: ``.N.gz`` → ``.(N+1).gz`` (delete the
       oldest beyond ``archive_keep``).

       rename to ``.1.gz``.
    4. Truncate the active log to zero bytes (writers reopen per
       append, so this is safe).

    If step 3 fails mid-way, the active log is left untouched and the
    exception propagates. Better to fail the rotation than to lose
    audit data — the next tick will retry.

    ``timestamp_field`` is the entry key holding an ISO 8601 timestamp.
    Defaults to ``"at"`` (the convention used by the supervisor's tick

    Malformed lines are skipped with a warning — the rotation must never
    abort on one bad row. Lines without the timestamp field are bucketed
    with the current year (treated as undated → kept in active).

    The active log is rewritten to contain only current-year entries.
    Cold-year entries become gzipped archives at
    ``<stem>.<year>.jsonl.gz`` (e.g. ``soul_audit.2024.jsonl.gz``).
