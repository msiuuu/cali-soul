"""Emotional state → structured biasing hints.

Each provider (Ollama, Claude, OpenAI, Kimi) renders these hints its own way
— prefill for Claude, structured system block for OpenAI, native SYSTEM for
Ollama+fine-tune. This module is provider-agnostic: it outputs the structure;
rendering lives in the bridge (Week 5).

Design per spec Section 5.2 (influence sub-module) and Section 5.5 (body-emotion
coupling). Keeps emotional intent flowing as structured data rather than a
pre-baked text blob.

# corrupt rule matching via `influence._TONE_RULES.append(...)`.
#
# Soft-coupling note (post vocabulary-split):
#   `creative_hunger` is no longer in the framework baseline — it lives in
#   per-persona emotion_vocabulary.json since the 2026-04-25 split. This rule
#   only fires when the persona's *currently dominant* emotion is named
#   `creative_hunger`, so personas that don't register that name simply never
#   hit the rule (graceful no-op). Other personas can opt in to the same
#   tone bias by registering an emotion with that exact name in their
#   vocabulary file. Future work (Phase 2 emergence + Tauri GUI) may move
#   tone bias to a per-emotion field in the persona's vocabulary so this
#   table doesn't have to know persona-specific names at all — for now,
#   the soft coupling is documented + intentional.
