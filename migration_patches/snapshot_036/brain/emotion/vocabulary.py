"""Emotion vocabulary — the typed taxonomy + persona extension registry.

Baseline: 26 emotions (11 core + 11 complex + 4 body) shipped with the framework.
Personas extend via register() — typically via the persona-loader at
engine startup, which reads `{persona_dir}/emotion_vocabulary.json`.
The 5 emotions previously in `nell_specific` (body_grief, emergence,
anchor_pull, creative_hunger, freedom_ache) are now per-persona and
ship via the migrator. See spec 2026-04-25-vocabulary-split-design.md.

Decay half-lives per spec Section 10.1:
- grief: 60-day half-life
- joy: 3-day half-life
- belonging / love: None (identity-level)
- others: seed values — tunable as we gather lived-experience data
