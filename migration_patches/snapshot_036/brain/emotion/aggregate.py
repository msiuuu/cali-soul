"""Aggregate a current EmotionalState from a list of memories.

Reflex uses this to evaluate arc triggers: what is the persona's
current emotional state, synthesized across recent memories.

Strategy: max-pool per emotion. The strongest signal across the
input memories wins — matches how OG reflex_engine read peaks,
not averages, for threshold evaluation.

After max-pooling, _apply_climax_reset is called: when aggregated
`climax >= 7` it dampens arousal + desire and raises comfort_seeking
+ rest_need, modeling the body's natural release cycle. Per spec
§2.2 of docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-body-state-design.md.
