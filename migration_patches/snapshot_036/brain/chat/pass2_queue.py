"""Process-global FIFO queue + single daemon worker for pass-2 extraction work.

Per-turn pass-2 extractions (monologue, attunement) are enqueued here instead of
spawning a thread per turn. A single worker drains them serially, acquiring the
``cli_throttle`` slot before each item — so interactive chat always has priority
and the worker serializes with the cadence engines — and **never drops** work
(except an overflow backstop). During active chat the worker waits and the queue
accumulates; when chat goes quiet it drains the backlog (consolidate during rest).

In-memory by design: un-drained items are lost on restart. Accepted — the raw
monologue is persisted synchronously to ``monologue_digest.jsonl`` at record time;
only the async EXTRACTION of not-yet-drained items is lost, a rare low-impact edge.

Public surface
--------------
enqueue(fn, *, label)
    Append a zero-arg callable. Overflow: at ``_MAX_QUEUE`` items, drop the OLDEST
    and log a WARNING (memory-safety backstop; debounce limits normal inflow).
    Lazily starts the single daemon worker, unless inhibited (tests).
drain_pending(max_items=None) -> int
    Synchronous drain (test helper): run items via the same ``_drain_one`` the
    worker uses, until empty / max reached / the throttle denies a slot. Returns
    the count run.
reset() -> None
    Test helper: stop the worker, empty the queue, clear state.
_queue_size() -> int
    Test helper: current queue length.

The drain logic lives in ONE place (``_drain_one``); both ``drain_pending`` and
the worker loop call it, so the per-item behaviour (throttle, pop, run, error
isolation, release) is identical and fully covered by the synchronous tests.
