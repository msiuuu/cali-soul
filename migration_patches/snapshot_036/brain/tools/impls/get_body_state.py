"""Real implementation of the get_body_state tool.

Reads aggregated emotion state (with climax reset already applied by
aggregate_state), gathers session inputs, computes BodyState, returns
its serialized form.

Stub previously returned loaded:False with placeholder fields; the real
impl returns loaded:True so the brain can distinguish "module is real"
from "module is pending". Spec §3.3, §7.3 (no silent failures via
deceptive stub-shape).
