"""Hebbian connection matrix with spreading activation.

Edges are undirected: edge (a, b) is stored canonically with the lower id
first to avoid duplicate rows. Weight accumulates over repeated strengthen()
calls; decay_all() reduces all weights (floored at 0); garbage_collect()
removes weak edges to keep the graph compact.

Spreading activation is a bounded BFS that propagates seed activation
through the graph, attenuating by (weight * decay_per_hop) at each hop.
Multi-path arrivals take the max (not sum) — prevents an activation
runaway on densely connected graphs.

Design per spec Section 4.1 (brain/memory/hebbian.py) and OG's F32/F33
Hebbian work.
