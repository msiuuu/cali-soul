"""brain.works.store — SQLite index for the works portfolio.

FENCED (v0.0.30): a tool surface with no autonomous writer/reader/feed —
kept available but intentionally not wired into the emotional/memory loops
(pre-Maker). See docs/maturity-manifest.md.

Mirrors brain/memory/store.py conventions:
- Open per-call (no long-lived connection that crosses threads).
- WAL mode for concurrent readers + single writer.
- Schema versioning via PRAGMA user_version.

The store is the index; the canonical content lives in markdown files
under persona/<name>/data/works/<id>.md (see brain.works.storage).
The store transaction is atomic internally; callers that also write markdown
must roll back the index row if the file write fails.

FTS5 virtual table (works_fts) powers search by title + summary +
content. Memory store uses LIKE-based search; works establishes the
FTS5 pattern as the project's first FTS user. Future memory work may
backport.
